"IP addresses can be said to consist of multiple parts, similar to how full street addresses consist of multiple parts. A street address can consist of the increasingly specific parts Country, City, Postal Code, Street and House Number. An IP address consists of two main parts:
üß© IP network and üß© addresses within the IP network. The addresses within the IP network are also called the host üéô addresses because different hosts (computers) have different unique addresses within the IP network.

üß© The IP network corresponds to more general parts of a full street address, such as City, Postal Code and Street name.
üß© The Host Addresses within the IP network correspond to specific house numbers on a street."

"But how can you tell if two IP addresses belong to same IP network? Unfortunately, it isn‚Äôt as easy to tell IP networks apart from one another as it is with street addresses. The answer is within something called a ü§° Subnet Mask. The Subnet Mask determines how much of the IP address that denominates which IP network the address belongs to. The rest of the IP address can then be used for computers and other hosts on the IP network."

"Both an IP address and a Subnet Mask consists of four parts separated by periods. Each part of an IP address and a Subnet Mask can have a value between 0-255"

"In its simplest form, each part of the Subnet Mask is either the number 255 or the number 0 (zero).

-> 255 means that the corresponding part of the IP address belongs to the IP network.
-> 0 (Zero) means that the corresponding part of the IP address belongs to the Host Addresses."

"In a normal home network, the Subnet Mask is usually ‚Äú255.255.255.0‚Äù. What that means is that the three first parts of the IP address determine which IP network that the IP addresses belong to. The last part of the IP address determines which unique address within that IP network that each individual computer has got.

As we mentioned earlier, each part of an IP address can have a value between 0-255. So the fourth part of the IP address permits for 256 different addresses (zero up to 255) that can be used for computers, IP phones, routers, laptops, printers and other devices. These type of devices are commonly referred to as hosts or clients. In a normal home network, those addresses are always more than enough to cover the devices that are connected to the network."

"What DHCP protocol does it use at the transport layer level?"

User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
DHCP uses User Datagram Protocol (UDP), RFC 768, as its transport protocol.

"Which of the following IP addresses is a private address?"

"Private (internal) addresses are not routed on the Internet and no traffic can be sent to them from the Internet, they only supposed to work within the local network.
Private addresses include IP addresses from the following subnets:

Range from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 ‚Äî a 10.0.0.0 network with a 255.0.0.0 or /8 (an 8-bit) mask

A 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 range, which is a 192.168.0.0 network masked by 255.255.0.0 or /16
A special range 100.64.0.0 to 100.127.255.255 with a 255.192.0.0 or /10 network mask; this subnet is recommended according to rfc6598 for use as an address pool for CGN (Carrier-Grade NAT)"

"Which IP address class has more host addresses available by default?"

"Class A addressing
Which class of IP address has the most host addresses available by default? Explanation: Class A addressing provides 24 bits for host addressing."

"Which protocol does Ping use?"

"ICMP
The program ping is one program that uses ICMP to determine whether a system is connected to the Internet (it uses the ICMP messages Echo Request and Echo Reply)."

[Ping] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/internet-control-message-protocol)

Domain name system is the way the internet domain names are stored and translated to IP addresses. The domain names systems matches the name of website to ip addresses of the website.

IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers that are typically displayed in dotted decimal notation. A 32-bit address contains two primary parts: the network prefix and the host number. All hosts within a single network share the same network address. Each host also has an address that uniquely identifies it.
